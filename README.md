# longest_palindrome_c

Solution to return the longest palindrome in C. Shouldn't timeout on exam.

Could be written better/smaller/cleaner but I tried to make it as descriptive as possible.

Commented c file is included with descriptions on whats going on.

Note: I don't know the actual subject of the exam question and whether its write biggest pal to stdout or
just return it. You can adapt it easily though.
